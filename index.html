   I am a student at Towers High Schoool and I love math, and civics. I am a 14 year old boy from Tampa, Florida. I love playing video games and socializing with people that
 makes me happy. Most of my friends are amazing people and I love them alot. The show me support and love throughtout my journey. I have 2 parents and 2 siblings. 
  Towers High School is an interesting school and a weird one. The kids here are also very interesting.

    I went to Whashington, D.C over the summer and it was an amazing trip. I saw the White House, Captital, and a zoo. I saw a water toot turtle, turtles, and  e.t.c .
   I enjoyed the time at the Whashington Nationals stadium against my Atlanta Braves. We lost but it was a amazing experience. Then after that me, my brother, sister, cousin, auntie, and grandma went to the National Museum of African-American.
